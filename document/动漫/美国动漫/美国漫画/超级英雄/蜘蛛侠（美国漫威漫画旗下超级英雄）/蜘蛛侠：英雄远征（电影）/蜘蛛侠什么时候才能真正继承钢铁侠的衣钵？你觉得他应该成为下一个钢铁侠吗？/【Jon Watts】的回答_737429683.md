 <p data-pid="WK8cXzNu">Spider-Man: Homecoming is the story of a kid who desperately wants to prove himself to the world and become an Avenger. Far From Home is the exact opposite. After the world changing events of Endgame the world is suddenly looking to Peter to step up and take Iron Man's place. But after everything that Peter has seen, he's now not so sure. What he realizes through the course of the story is that his responsibility is bigger than he ever imagined, and that he has to step up. But not as the next Iron Man. As the first Spider-Man.</p>
 <p data-pid="YQ-TuaB2">I think that Peter thought he was ready for the next phase, as long as he was able to keep his identity secret. But now that the world know who he is, he's suddenly going to have a whole new set of problems to deal with. He may have gained the self confidence to believe in himself, even though he's just a sixteen-year-old kid from Queens. But now the world will be asking the same questions, and he's going to have to find a way to convince them, too.</p>

 <p data-pid="OGOjS4Vd">如果说，《蜘蛛侠：英雄归来》讲的是一个男孩拼命想向世界证明自己并成为复仇者联盟一员的故事，那么《蜘蛛侠：英雄远征》恰恰相反。当终局之战改变了世界之后，世界急切期盼彼得能站出来并成为下一个“钢铁侠”。但在彼得见识过所有的事情之后，已经不那么确定自己真的能行了。他在整个故事过程中意识到的是，他应当承担的责任比他想象中的要多的多，而他必须站出来，变得更强。但，这并不意味着他要成为下一个钢铁侠，而是成为一位真正的蜘蛛侠。</p>
 <p data-pid="ZPU8aq8P">我觉得彼得以为他已经为下一阶段做好了准备，只要他能保密他的身份。但现在全世界都知道了他是谁，因此他还需要解决一系列新的、急需处理的问题。或许他已经收获了信心去信任自己，尽管这只是一个来自皇后区的十六岁男孩。但现在全世界都会问他同样的问题，他也必须要找到一种方式来令大家去相信。</p>
