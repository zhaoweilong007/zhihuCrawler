 <p data-pid="MtgyxWfR">Thanks for inviting!</p>
 <p data-pid="LQY4mr07">As most of you probably know, I recently had surgery to remove the plate and screws that were put in my ankle after I broke it in the opener. It’s not something we were expecting to be a part of this recovery process, but I’m happy to report that I’ll be back out there resuming rehab soon, with my sights set firmly on being back to my usual self for the start of next season.</p>
 <p data-pid="cEsW4uuh">I had been progressing really well. I had been doing cuts laterally. I was jumping. I hadn’t done anything that explosive and I wasn’t quite 100 percent with any of it, but I was slowly building up to that.</p>

 <p data-pid="Ir0dLTc0">Problem was, I was also still having some pain on the outside of my ankle, kind of where the peroneal tendon is. I had been reporting back daily how I was feeling, and the team that I was working with in Indianapolis—along with the Celtics training staff—had surmised that it could be the hardware they put in during my initial surgery causing some irritation.</p>
 <p data-pid="mc7-2o1P">And all I knew was that I was experiencing pain, and something didn’t feel right.</p>
 <p data-pid="pIcnBfMM">So I called up Dr. Porter, who collaborated on my surgery and who’s advised us throughout this process, just to ask what he thought. I explained to him what was going on, and he said it could be a couple different things, so we should do a test to figure out what it is. He told me that it could just be that my muscles were sore, and it was a strength issue, and I just needed to continue to rehab and have it get stronger, and eventually, it would go away. Or it could be something different.</p>
 <p data-pid="aRqXopgl">So I flew back to Indianapolis and did what is called a Cybex test. Essentially, they used it to test the strength in both my ankles. The first round that I did the test, my left ankle was significantly weaker than my right. It was approximately 70 percent of the strength of the right ankle. On a test like that, 30 percent is a pretty significant number, so that raised some red flags.</p>
 <p data-pid="fK4blSDe">Then Dr. Porter injected my left ankle with some local anesthetic to numb the area, and I did the same test again. That time, not only was my left 100 percent of the strength of my right, it was actually slightly stronger. That let Dr. Porter know that it was not a strength issue, but a pain issue, and the pain was basically blocking my progression.</p>
 <p data-pid="f2l89yHl">That revelation made it pretty clear that it was the hardware that was causing the issue. According to both doctors, it is something that is very rare. Usually, you don’t have to take out the hardware. I remember when I got the surgery done in the first place, they told me, “We are probably not going to have to take out the hardware, but you never know.”</p>
 <p data-pid="q1opuGWk">So we got on a conference call with Dr. Porter, and the doctors and staff in Boston, and collectively decided that we should take the hardware out of my ankle.</p>
 <p data-pid="fxrkPLUN">The next night I was in surgery. Dr. Porter went in and took out everything that they had put in my ankle. There were two incisions made to take all the stuff out. They took the plate, the screws and the tightrope that was in there. So now, I basically have a normal ankle—just there are some holes in the bone where they had to put the screws in, and those are going to heal up.</p>
 <p data-pid="Wd3-X0nK">Honestly, I look it as a good thing more than anything, because when you introduce foreign objects into your body, anything can happen at any time. Sometimes your body rejects it or things happen; you get infections, and it could happen a year or years down the road. So it’s nice to know that I’m done with the plate and screws now, and that is not something I am going to have to worry about in the future.</p>

 <p data-pid="pzEyLGrQ">The surgery went really well, and the wound recovered great. I did more further movement training recently, now we move on.</p>
 <p data-pid="Kw4HOTjC">谢谢邀请我回答这个问题，也谢谢 <a class="member_mention" href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/6ab20306a1f460e3f1457004b63736a9" data-hash="6ab20306a1f460e3f1457004b63736a9" data-hovercard="p$b$6ab20306a1f460e3f1457004b63736a9">@聚星动力</a> 的朋友帮我翻译！</p>
 <p data-pid="uuYp-jy3">很多球迷可能已经知道了，我最近做了一个手术，取出了在揭幕战受伤后放入我脚踝内的钢板和螺钉。这原本不是我预期恢复过程中的一部分，但我很高兴告诉大家我很快就可以健康复出了。我坚信下赛季开始时会找回曾经的那个自己。</p>
 <p data-pid="KlwL0fz0">我之前一直恢复得不错，尝试做一些横向移动、跳跃的练习。我还没有做过任何激烈的运动，因为我还不能百分之百发力，但我正在慢慢适应。</p>
 <p data-pid="uW8hA1xs">问题出现的那天我觉得我的脚踝外侧有一些疼痛，大概在腓骨肌腱的位置。我每天都会向团队汇报我当天的感受，我在印第安纳波利斯的医疗团队和凯尔特人队的训练人员猜测，这可能是由于初次手术时在我脚踝中植入的硬件造成了一些刺激。</p>
 <p data-pid="Ls9-_uwh">我只知道我感受到了疼痛，而这并不是正常的反应。</p>
 <p data-pid="0x12hqWV">于是我联系了波特医生询问他的想法，他是我手术的主刀医生并且在我的恢复过程中一直给我建议。我向他解释发生了什么，他说这可能由一系列复杂的原因引起，我们需要先做个测试来找到真正的原因。他告诉我这可能只是因为肌肉酸痛，这是力量方面的问题，我只需要继续做康复训练让它变得更强，之后疼痛感就会消失了。或者还可能由别的原因引起。</p>
 <p data-pid="CgTMO8jK">因此我飞回印第安纳波利斯做了一个叫Cybex的测试，主要是测试我脚踝的力量。第一轮测试结果显示，我的左脚踝力量明显弱于右脚踝，差不多只是右脚踝70%的力量。在这种测试中，30%的差距意味着非常明显的不足，这让我的团队意识到了问题的严重性。</p>
 <p data-pid="0c_mOtD0">之后波特医生给我的左脚踝注射了一些麻药，然后进行了相同的测试。这次，我的左脚踝不仅能和右脚踝承受完全相同的力量，反而还要更强一些。这让波特医生明白了这不是力量问题，而是疼痛问题，这种疼痛影响了我的恢复进展。</p>
 <p data-pid="wMrArJvk">测试结果清晰地表明了我的脚踝里有硬件出了问题。医生们都说这种情况非常罕见。通常来说，你不必取出这些硬件。我记得我做完第一次手术时他们告诉我：“我们很可能不会取出这些硬件，但是也说不准。”</p>
 <p data-pid="8_-8wFUq">于是我们和波特医生以及其他在波士顿的医疗人员进行了视频会议，他们一致决定应当把我脚踝里的硬件取出来。</p>
 <p data-pid="KcEpbmJ1">第二天我就进行了手术。波特医生主刀取出了之前植入我脚踝的所有硬件。他在我的脚踝处切开两个口子，取出了里面的钢板、螺丝和钢钉。所以现在我拥有了完全正常的脚踝，只是在原来插入钢钉的骨头上还留有几个洞，只能等它们自己长好。</p>
 <p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p>
 <p data-pid="AA4dXPAY">老实说，我把它看做是一件前所未有的好事，因为当你身体里有异物的时候，你不知道它什么时候会发生怎样的意外。有时候你的身体会出现排异反应，比如发生感染，甚至有可能在一年或几年之后才出现。所以我现在已经完全没有这种苦恼了，取出了钢板和钢钉，不必再担心未来是否会出现意外。</p>
 <p data-pid="RyieANSo">我的手术非常顺利，伤口愈合情况也很好，最近我做了很多更进一步的训练，现在正在恢复之路上继续前进。</p><a class="video-box" href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.zhihu.com/video/1010550957775695872" target="_blank" data-video-id="" data-video-playable="true" data-name="" data-poster="https://pic2.zhimg.com/80/v2-6033f69614ccd874187808d7270abd05_b.jpg" data-lens-id="1010550957775695872"><img class="thumbnail" src="https://pic2.zhimg.com/80/v2-6033f69614ccd874187808d7270abd05_b.jpg"><span class="content"><span class="title"><span class="z-ico-extern-gray"></span><span class="z-ico-extern-blue"></span></span><span class="url"><span class="z-ico-video"></span>https://www.zhihu.com/video/1010550957775695872</span></span></a>
