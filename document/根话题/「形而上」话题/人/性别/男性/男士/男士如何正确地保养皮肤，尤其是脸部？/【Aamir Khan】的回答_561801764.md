 <p data-pid="bGZRbz9y">I think for a lot of things, I have to thank my mother. And this is one of them.</p>
 <p data-pid="841APWj5">Because she looks very beautiful and young. I think I got my looks from my mother, and I don't really do anything with my skin. My wife makes fun of me, because most actors, they look after their hair and skin, they put on moisturizer and user conditioner for their hair. But I don't do that, sometimes I don’t even wash my face. (Well maybe that’s the secret.).</p>
 <p data-pid="i8srdv0x">For the longest time, I was not using shampoo, I was using soap. And then somebody told me you shouldn’t use soap, it’s very harsh, it’ll ruin your hair. You should use shampoo. So I said, okay, only by then I started to use shampoo. I know these products meant to make you look better, but I don’t have the patience for that, to be quite honest.</p>
 <p data-pid="uB2M6cz6">My wife always tell me:“you're an actor, you need to look after your skin.” And every now and then, she buys me things. But they are always unopened, because I don't use them.</p>
 <p data-pid="3Cl8EPf1">The funniest thing is that in my head, I’m still 18 years old. Sometimes when I meet someone, I would call them aunt or auntie, but they could be of the same age with me. Maybe I still think of myself as “little fresh meat”。 ;)</p>
