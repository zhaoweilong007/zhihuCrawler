 <p>这篇带领大家一扫四六级的作文和翻译题型<span><span>，</span></span>并为大家准备了最干的干货<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>先说作文<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>一<span><span>、</span></span>作文</p>
 <p>作为四六级来说<span><span>，</span></span>总结模板还是比较重要的<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>作文一上来就开始写<span><span>，</span></span>而且时间也相对较短<span><span>，</span></span>作为模板而言<span><span>，</span></span>也不用觉得烂大街的就不用<span><span>，</span></span>这是等级性考试<span><span>，</span></span>而不是选拔式考试<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>看到很多类型的作文都有各自的模板<span><span>，</span></span>真的也没必要<span><span>，</span></span>这一篇可以覆盖所有作文题型<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>我比较喜欢从作文答案总结规律<span><span>，</span></span>而不是另辟蹊径<span><span>，</span></span>毕竟这也是应试考试<span><span>，</span></span>没有必要放飞自我<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>接下来的回答范文基本都是我从历届考试真题中总结出来的模板<span><span>，</span></span>你们可以一边对照真题作文的题目<span><span>，</span></span>一边看我的分析<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>所包含的句型来源于历届答案的一些句型<span><span>，</span></span>更具有实用性<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>从历届真题来看<span><span>，</span></span>作文一般来说<span><span>，</span></span>有 2 种模式的题型<span><span>。</span></span>2021 年 6 月份六级作文新增了一种<span><span>，</span></span>漫画题型<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>不过<span><span>，</span></span>不管哪种模式的题型<span><span>，</span></span>模板都可以套用一样的<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>分开头<span><span>、</span></span>中间主体<span><span>、</span></span>结尾三部分<span><span>。</span></span>开头和结尾不需要过多思考<span><span>，</span></span>以最快的方式解决<span><span>。</span></span>开头约 30 词<span><span>，</span></span>结尾约 30 词<span><span>，</span></span>总共 60 词左右<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>中间大概用 100 词左右解决<span><span>，</span></span>可以根据思路套句进行扩展<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>话不多说<span><span>，</span></span>直接上干货<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p><strong><span><span>（</span></span>一<span><span>）</span></span><span><span>、</span></span>典型性议论文<span><span>，</span></span>题目是一句<span><span>「</span></span>名言<span><span>」</span></span></strong></p>
 <p>以 2020 年 9 月作文为例</p>
 <p>第一套<span><span>：</span></span>Beauty of the soul is the essential beauty.</p>
 <p>第二套<span><span>：</span></span>What is worth doing is worth doing well.</p>
 <p>第三套<span><span>：</span></span>Wealth of the mind is the only true wealth.</p>
 <p><strong><span><span>（</span></span>二<span><span>）</span></span><span><span>、</span></span>非典型性议论文<span><span>，</span></span>题目是一个短语/how/why/what</strong></p>
 <p>以 2019 年 12 月作文为例</p>
 <p>第一套<span><span>：</span></span>the importance of having a sense of social responsibility.</p>
 <p>第二套<span><span>：</span></span>the importance of having a sense of family responsibility.</p>
 <p>第三套<span><span>：</span></span>the importance of having a sense of community responsibility.</p>
 <p>对于以上这两种类型的作文<span><span>，</span></span>可以总结成一个模板进行<span><span>，</span></span>毕竟有相似之处<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>提出 2 个论点即可<span><span>，</span></span>1 个论点有时候也可以<span><span>，</span></span>但是你未必能扩展得那么深刻<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>针对这三个部分<span><span>，</span></span>下面附上我的常用表达<span><span>，</span></span>不在于多<span><span>，</span></span>在于精通<span><span>。</span></span></p>

 <p>写法<span><span>：</span></span></p>

Just as the saying goes, <span><span>「</span></span><strong>Beauty of the soul is the essential beauty.</strong><span><span>」</span></span><span><span>（</span></span>30 词左右<span><span>）</span></span></p>

 <p>模板<span><span>：</span></span>Nowadays, there has been growing awareness that +题目+plays an/a important/significant role in living/our daily life. So each of us should learn to +题目去掉动词.</p>
 <p>分析<span><span>：</span></span>摆出现象<span><span>，</span></span>呼吁开头<span><span>，</span></span>开门见山<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>写法<span><span>：</span></span></p>

 <p>Tip:这个开头简直百发百中<span><span>，</span></span>在历届作文中都可以这么套用<span><span>，</span></span>这几天可以自己试着练习历届作文题目<span><span>。</span></span></p>
 <p>到考场上看到作文题不至于想半天<span><span>，</span></span>直接直奔主题<span><span>，</span></span>节省写作时间<span><span>。</span></span></p>

 <p>模板<span><span>：</span></span>Everyone has certain roles to take on in his or her family. <span><span>（</span></span>总结句<span><span>）</span></span></p>
 <p>Parents are expected to ensure their children are well-nourished and well-educated, helping them build a strong body and great character. 现象一般情况<span><span>（</span></span>背景＋作用<span><span>）</span></span></p>
 <p>We college students also need to take our responsibility as adult children. Being independent of our parents as early as possible lightens the financial burden on them. Learning to be mature and sensible can prevent us from becoming a constant source of worry to them. Fulfilling our filial duty to the best of our abilities allows them to enjoy life in midlife years, retirement, and the twilight years. 学生自身<span><span>（</span></span>背景+怎么做<span><span>）</span></span></p>

 <p>Unmotivated students, in contrast, feel like they are forced to learn and get bored easily with this seemingly endless process.<span><span>（</span></span>反面<span><span>）</span></span></p>
 <p>In addition, proper methods are a contributing factor in increased efficiency and positive learning outcomes. Top students don<span><span>』</span></span>t necessarily spend the most amount of time on learning, but more often than not have found the right ways to improve their academic performance.<span><span>（</span></span>展望<span><span>）</span></span></p>

 <p>写法<span><span>：</span></span></p>
 <p>The above chart shows that the past three decades have seen great progress in China's higher education. According to the data from the Ministry of Education, China's gross enrolment ratio</p>
 <p>in higher education has increased from 3. 4 % in 1990 to 51. 6% in 2019.<span><span>（</span></span>40 词左右<span><span>）</span></span></p>
