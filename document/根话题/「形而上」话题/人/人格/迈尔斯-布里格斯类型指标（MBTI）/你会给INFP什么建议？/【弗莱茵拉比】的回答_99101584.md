 <p data-pid="-D4Htpdi">注：因为原文比较长，所以列出大纲供参考，重点建议在第七、八、九节，一到四在解析 INFP 的特点和优势，五六在解析 INFP 的性格盲点，七是归纳如何克服性格盲点，八是建议如何适应社会，九是总结最终的十条建议。这十条建议我会不时重新阅读，看看自己近一段时间在这些方面做得如何。个人认为这十条就像一面让自己迈向喜悦与平和的镜子，还是很有用的，关注结论的朋友可以直接看第九节。</p>
 <p data-pid="ft0E9ajO">-----------------------</p>
 <p data-pid="FdtEYKLi"><u><b>一、对于一个INFP来说，成功是什么？ </b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="Luc43clI">INFP们是创造性的，感性的灵魂，他们非常真诚地对待他们的生活。他们在和别人的关系中寻找和谐和真实性。他们重视创造性、精神性（灵性）并敬重独立的自我高于一切。他们很容易调整对人们的不公平和不公正，并且从克服这些不公平的成功中得到很大的满足。INFP是一个完美主义者，很少允许自己感到成就感，尽管他们对失败很敏感。INFP们在运用他们的创造性时感到满足。</p>
 <p data-pid="UPz-Mojl">对于INFP，个人的成功依赖于：他们最亲近的人际关系的情况、他们创造性能力的发展、持续的人性（仁慈博爱）精神支撑（通过对有需要的人进行服务），和不公平的对抗，或者其他令世界变得更美好的工作。</p>
 <br>
 <p data-pid="PFoNkJ43"><b><u>二、如何让你的INFP力量强健 </u></b></p>
 <p data-pid="QJLhMjsV">作为一个INFP,你有其他类型所没有的特殊天赋。通过认定你的特殊天赋并激励它们的成长和发展，你将更容易地看到你在世界上的位置，并知道如何更好地运用你的天赋来达到你的梦想。几乎所有的INFP们会认可在他们身上有下列的特性。他们应该领会和加强这些力量：</p>
 <p data-pid="fh9GOqnE"><u>a、高度的创造性，艺术性和神性</u>，他们可以在艺术、音乐和文学方面有极好造诣。</p>
 <p data-pid="4NO5CNTl">INFP是天生的艺术家。如果他们激励并发展了他们的艺术能力，他们会感到很大的满足。这并不是说为了感到满足，他们只能选择成为一个著名的作家或者画家。只是创造性的工作对于INFP是自我恢复和充实的完全源泉。一个INFP应该给自己一些其“艺术性”的抒发途径，因为这将给他们的生活增添丰富和积极的精神力。</p>
 <p data-pid="xxC6A_1l"><u>b、一个INFP应该强健他们的信仰。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="ZAl3bC90">他们比大多数人更关注精神层面，并比其他人更多和自己灵魂的接触。大多数INFP有强烈的信仰。但是在他们失去一些重要的东西前可能无法发现这一点。</p>
 <p data-pid="lZ8-P6_7"><u>c、帮助受压迫者或不幸的人实现社会公平。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="5Gi0Xi53">INFP对社会上的不公平很在意，并同情受压迫者。他们对受压迫者的同情和对社会不公平的过度在意令他们极端具有同情心并对我们社会中处于劣势的成员进行扶持。INFP在努力帮助我们社会中不幸的人们的过程中感到最大的有益和充实。他们可能是教师、大臣、作家、顾问或心理学家，但是所有的INFP都非常可能花费额外的时间来试图帮助人们解决特殊问题。一个INFP在促成某种能够帮助受压迫者的社会变革时会感到极大的满足。</p>
 <p data-pid="oT-R6RLY"><u>d、在倾听中成为他人的顾问，帮助他人。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="Gkd4IyTc">他们通常是好的倾听者，真诚地希望倾听别人的问题并真诚地希望帮助他们。这使他们成为杰出的顾问，和好朋友。一个INFP在义务地充当顾问时感到很大的满足。</p>
 <p data-pid="-h3q2P0T"><u> e、接纳被社会负面判定的个体，肯定任何人存在的价值</u></p>
 <p data-pid="0NpEWHzE">他们认可并重视人们作为个体的存在，并抱有强的平等主义。他们相信一个个体拥有成为他自己的权利，而并不仔细审查对方的态度和观点。因此，他们在和可能通常遭到社会负面判定的人接触时有很强的容忍和接受力。他们可以在每个人身上看到值得肯定的东西。他们信仰个体。如果他们给自己机会，对于那些自己无法找到自尊和信心的人，一个INFP可以成为这些积极力量的源泉。因此，他们可以滋养一个“生病的灵魂”回复健康。</p>
 <p data-pid="Xa6hNyya"><u>f、在智力和思考上进行一定的追求。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="OWVjb40f">他们通常深沉并有才智，能够相对容易地理解困难的观念。他们通常在学术上表现出色，并会发现对智力的训练令他们对进行深层思考的需求更甚。</p>
 <p data-pid="mh-TglRn"><u><br><br><b>三、外倾直觉（Ne）发展成熟的 INFP 的天赋</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="OIwJ4a6b">那些发展了他们外倾直觉途径并且达到了可以客观并快速地感知他们周围世界的程度的INFP们，会发现他们享有如下非常特别的天赋：</p>
 <p data-pid="AfrH2Z2L"><u>a、他们会有对人们的性格特性有很强的洞察力。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="KSdrXcZR">他们会通过评估其动机和感情，快速并透彻地了解一个人的来处(原文‘where a person is coming from’不知道该怎么翻译)。这些很好地发展了的INFP个体们可以成为杰出的心理学家（比如Isabel Briggs Myers本人[MBTI理论缔造者]）和顾问。他们也可以成为伟大的小说家，因为他们能够塑造非常复杂且真实的性格。</p>
 <p data-pid="ii-sjZAH"><u>b、他们会快速地了解不同的情况，和快速地理解新观念。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="VmpS1DXU">他们会发现自己能够胜任任何其致力于的事情，即使这事情可能并不令他们满足。对这些INFP们，事情可以看上去变得简单。虽然他们能够胜任很多不同种类的任务和情况，这些INFP在做看上去真地对他们重要的事情时会感到最快乐。尽管他们可能发现他们可以相对容易地达到“主流”意义上的成功，他们可能在这条路上无法找到快乐，除非他们真诚地并有深度地过着他们的生活。</p>
 <br>
 <p data-pid="VjhdnO5j"><b><u>四、内倾情感（Fi）发展成熟的 INFP 的天赋</u></b></p>
 <p data-pid="hvhYTXMG"><u>引领和推动道德与美的层面的社会变革</u></p>
 <p data-pid="UC0XQgU0">INFP如果加强他强大的内在价值体系（内倾感情），并有一个很好发展的感知世界的直觉途径（外倾直觉），可以成为一个社会变革的强有力推动力。他们强烈的道德标准和对生活水平低下者的深感同情，加上对我们生活的世界可靠的深刻的理解，形成一个拥有造成变革能力的个体。（例如Mother Teresa[特雷萨修女，诺贝尔和平奖获得者] ）</p>
 <br>
 <p data-pid="kIKLpKc9"><b><u>五、潜在的问题区域 </u></b></p>
 <p data-pid="nKn2Yu8v">伴随着一个天生的长处，就有一个相对应的短处。没有“坏”就没有“好”。没有“难”就没有“易”。我们重视我们的长处，但是我们常常诅咒和忽视我们的短处。为了作为一个人成长并从生活中得到我们想要的，我们必须不仅仅将我们的长处资本化，也要正视我们的短处并处理它们。这意味着要重视我们性格类型的潜在问题区域。</p>
 <p data-pid="M0zqhjgG">我希望INFP在阅读下面这些较负面的资料时，心中要牢记作为一个INFP所拥有的许多正面的东西。也记住作为一个INFP所存在的弱点对你这个类型来说是自然的事情。尽管阅读这些关于你所属类型的弱点的内容可能会令人郁闷，请记住我们提供这些信息是为了提出积极的改善意见。我们希望人们发展他们的潜力，拥有一个快乐和成功的生活。</p>
 <p data-pid="OUzKr3R0">在INFP身上找到的大多数的性格弱点是由于他们支配性的F（感情）功能遮盖了他们其他的个性。当内倾感情的支配性功能遮盖了所有其他，一个INFP无法使用它外倾直觉来真实客观地搜集信息。在这样的情况下，一个INFP可能不同程度地呈现出下列弱点中的部分或者全部：</p>
 <p data-pid="nWnimUwc">可能对任何形式的批判都极端敏感</p>
 <p data-pid="oehMTFQG">可能在没有人意指的情况下察觉到批判</p>
 <p data-pid="0lN2gLT_">可能对现实有歪斜的或不切实际的观点</p>
 <p data-pid="kDyBqbNY">可能无法承认或听取任何和他们个人的观点和想法相违背的东西</p>
 <p data-pid="nZTEBGSD">可能将他们的问题怪罪到别人身上，认为他们自己是被不公平对待的牺牲者</p>
 <p data-pid="zTaJdAFy">可能有大火气，并且用很坏的态度将这怒火鲁莽地发泄出去</p>
 <p data-pid="wzZloFQl">可能不在意适当的社会举止</p>
 <p data-pid="xO_l-fY8">可能对他们个人的外貌或恰当的衣着容易忽略</p>
 <p data-pid="8JKtHMo2">可能给人为人古怪的印象，或可能甚至普遍地与其他人不同，且自己意识不到</p>
 <p data-pid="uVYU---b">可能无法看到或理解任何其他人的观点</p>
 <p data-pid="57cWt9bQ">可能重视他们自己的观点和感觉远高于其他人</p>
 <p data-pid="smYlyl9C">可能对他们的行为给别人的影响毫无察觉</p>
 <p data-pid="lT9rgk0e">可能对他人的需求不在意</p>
 <p data-pid="ExrsOI3Z">可能在某人表达对INFP的不同意和不赞成时，感到压倒性的紧张和压力</p>
 <p data-pid="wAV2Lnzc">可能对那些他们感到已经压迫或压制他们的人，发展出强烈的难以更改的判定</p>
 <p data-pid="N4I6jYko">在大的压力下，可能被对事情的全局不重要的细节缠住 [汗……钻牛角尖]</p>
 <p data-pid="RQmLtdir">在压力下，可能强迫性的对一个问题再三思索 [再汗……强迫症]</p>
 <p data-pid="ZYN8S822">可能对他人抱有不切实际的期望</p>
 <p data-pid="EukWApiP">可能在保持亲密关系上有困难，因为不切实际的期望。</p>
 <br>
 <p data-pid="khVtJBrh"><b><u>六、潜在问题的说明</u></b></p>
 <p data-pid="12idOaf7">几乎所有上面描述的有问题的特性可以不同程度地归结于一个普遍的INFP问题——只接收证明他们个人观点正确的信息。INFP通常是十分认真的和敏感的人，感觉到强烈的被批判的威胁。、在他们自己的观念里，似乎认为任何和他们自己不同的观点就是批判。如果INFP没有学会怎么去处理这个感觉到的批判，那么INFP会开始将令他们痛苦的信息拒之门外。这是INFP人格的天生的生存技巧。INFP人格的主要驱动力是内倾的情感，其目的是保持和尊崇一个强烈的个人价值和道德体系。如果一个INFP个人价值体系受到外来影响的威胁，INFP会排除威胁性信息，以此来保持和尊崇他们的价值体系。这是完全天生的，且对于保护个人心智免遭伤害很有用。然而，练习这种类型的自我保护的INFP往往会变得越来越不在意别人的观点，并因此越来越远离于拥有一个对他们生活着的世界真实的理解。他们会总是觉得他们不适当的行为是合理的，且总是因为在生活中的问题而和外部世界找茬。对他们而言，保持亲密的个人人际关系是困难的，因为他们有不切实际的期望，并且无法接受责备。</p>
 <p data-pid="oSWwNOtS">对INFP而言，从外部世界搜集支持他们的观点和价值的信息，是个常见的倾向。然而，如果这个倾向被赋予完全的统治地位，导致的INFP人格将太过自我中心以至于无法快乐和成功。因为INFP的性格支配性功能是内倾感情，他们必须平衡其和辅助性的外倾直觉的关系。INFP通过外倾直觉来获取信息。这也是INFP与外部世界相处的根本途径。如果INFP将外倾直觉仅用在服务于内倾感情的意志，那么这个INFP完全没有有效地运用外倾直觉。而结果是，这个INFP没有得到足够的关于外部世界的信息，从而无法对正在发生的事情有一个好的感知。他们除了自己的观点什么也看不到，且仅在他们因为需要支持他们的观点时才和外部世界接触。他们通常给人留下自私和不切实际的印象。根据问题的严重性，印象可能表现为从“有一点古怪”到“敬而远之”中的任何程度。很多时候其他人无法理解或和这些人进行交流。</p>
 <br>
 <p data-pid="j4sCLAI_"><b><u>七、潜在问题的解决方法 </u></b></p>
 <p data-pid="dm_7JPGJ">为了作为一个个体成长，INFP需要致力于开放他们的观念，来接收一个对于在世界上正在发生的事情更正确的图景。为了处于一个能够感知和思考和他们内在价值体系不同的信息的位置，INFP需要知道他的价值体系并没有受到新信息的威胁。INFP必须有意识地告诉自己：一个不认同于自己观点的观点并不是对他整个性格的控诉。</p>
 <p data-pid="iJiFAdXA">关注个人成长的INFP者会密切注意他们获取信息的动机。他们获取信息是否是为了更好的理解一个状况或观念？还是，他们获取信息来支持个人的观点或理念？当感知到一些东西的时候，这个INFP有没有扭曲那感知来使它和他的个人价值观相符合？还是关注客观地吸收信息？为了达到对外部世界更好的理解，INFP应该在将信息与他们的价值体系相配之前，试着客观地感知信息，他们应该有意识地注意他们抛弃任何不支持他们价值观的东西的倾向，并且努力减轻这种倾向。他们应该试着从别人的观点出发看情况，不带着对情况或别人观点的个人判断。一般来说，他们应该努力在真实的外倾感知中练习他们的直觉。换句话说，他们应该出于理解世界的目的运用直觉获取关于他们所处世界的信息，而不是获取信息来支持他们自己的结论。成功地客观地感知事物的INFP，可以是积极变革的有力推动力量。</p>
 <br>
 <p data-pid="KPhrWZhh"><b><u>八、如何作为一个INFP快活地生活在我们的世界上 </u></b></p>
 <p data-pid="gcx8lIpS">有些INFP在适应融入我们的社会方面有困难。他们的问题通常是<b><u>对合适的社会行为的无意识</u></b>、<u><b>对给他人留有的印象的不在意</b></u>、或<u><b>对他人不切实际的期望</b></u>造成的。这三个原因任何之一都可以用外倾直觉来减轻。一个INFP出于理解身边世界的目的获取信息，而不是为了支持自己的观点而获取信息，则会对社会价值社会行为和态度是怎样的有一个更清晰更客观的理解。他也会更在意他给别人的印象如何，并且在一段人际关系中对他人的表现有更实际的期望。这样调整好地INFP能很愉快地适应我们的社会。</p>
 <p data-pid="Y-DeHb6O">除非你真的理解心理类型和不同人格功能的细微差别，否则突然开始在外倾方向运用直觉是个困难的任务。甚至理解这是什么意思都很难，更何况将这个指示结合到你的生活中。因为知道这一点，我提供一些明确的建议，可以更充分地帮助你开始练习你的外倾直觉：</p>
 <p data-pid="L2JVbRvE"><u>a、注意处于不同的社会环境时人们看上去是怎样的。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="UfzX902h">看他们的发型、他们的皮肤、他们的妆容（或者素面朝天）、他们的衣着，他们衣着的情况，他们的鞋子，他们的面部表情。别把别人和你自己所表现出的相比，或对他们的表现作出判定，只是获取信息。</p>
 <p data-pid="v_3PH2Cd"><u>b、想象一个你生活中的情况，在这个情况下你不确定该采取怎样的行动。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="kyQRfIRC">现在试着了解一个或两个别的人会怎样看待这样的情况。别把他们的行为和你的相比，也就是“他比我知道该怎么做”或“为什么这对他来说这么容易，对我却这么难”。而是试着理解他们怎么看待这样的情况。它会被看作是个问题，还是一个机遇？它会被看得很重还是很轻？试着确定他们的观点，不带做判定或和你自己的比较。</p>
 <p data-pid="G8ZWln4L"><u>c、当和一个亲友有交谈时，贡献出你起码一半的时间来讨论其他的人。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="EvH0qaaY">集中精力于从他们的关注角度理解他们从哪儿来 [再次遇到‘where that person is coming from’,不确定其含义]。问问题。</p>
 <p data-pid="JZ_i6-kp"><u>d、关心离你最近的人。</u></p>
 <p data-pid="wtd8C1sL">当你注意到任何一个人时，告诉你自己：“这个人有他自己在进行的生活，且他对自己生活的关注远甚于对我的。”记住这不意味着他们不在意你。这是事情的自然顺序。试着想象那个人现在正在做什么。他正遭遇什么事情，他在想些什么。别作判定，别把他们的情况和你自己的相比较。</p>
 <p data-pid="QxJGTSbu"><u>e、试着鉴别每一个你接触了任意长时间的人的人格类型。</u></p>
 <br>
 <p data-pid="OHNezZj3"><u><b>九、达到INFP的成功须遵守的十条准则 </b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="oOr8XvNU"><u><b>1、增强你的力量！</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="mtpsw759">激励你天生的艺术才能和创造性。滋养你的灵性。给你自己机会去帮助贫困者或下层社会的人。</p>
 <p data-pid="YrcYQu1A"><u><b>2、直面你的弱点！</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="7pt_2tix">认识和接受一些特性是优势而另一些是弱点。直面并处理你的弱点并不意味着你不得不改变得不像你，它意味着你希望成为可能的最好的你。通过直面你的弱点，你在尊敬你的真实自我，而不是攻击你自己。</p>
 <p data-pid="CyFOZ_oj"><u><b>3、表达你的感情。</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="D-HqCZBH">别让未表达的情绪在你心里堆积。如果你有强烈的感觉，挑出它们、表达它们，别让他们在你心里堆积到变得无法管理的程度。</p>
 <p data-pid="QPUP9KKj"><u><b>4、倾听任何事情。</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="6fOQd1ro">试着不要立刻摒弃任何东西。让所有信息都吸收一会儿，然后进行判断。</p>
 <p data-pid="Bnjrc0UZ"><u><b>5、对批判一笑置之。</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="141RADCk">记住人们不会总是同意或理解你，甚至即使他们非常重视你。试着把不同意和批判看作成长的机会。事实上，它们的确就是。</p>
 <p data-pid="EvZsvpww"><u><b>6、在意他人。</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="vXsEQ5w3">记住世界上另外有15种不同的性格类型，他们看事物和你完全不同。试着鉴别别人的类型。试着理解他们的观点。</p>
 <p data-pid="1TYJzblX"><u><b>7、对你自己负责。</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="a1-52hT1">记住对自己的生活，你比任何其他人有更多的控制权。</p>
 <p data-pid="M-lwzlxE"><u><b>8、温和地期盼。</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="7YCB8rKR">如果你对别人期盼太多你就会总是感到失望。对另一个人失望是把他从身边赶走的最佳途径。以自己希望被对待的温和来对待他人。</p>
 <p data-pid="1DsrXm-s"><u><b>9、假定最好的。</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="dcMGvJXz">别通过假定最坏的情况来使自己忧伤。记住一个积极的态度常常会创造积极的局面。</p>
 <p data-pid="6z-1eaOk"><u><b>10、当你有困惑，问问题！</b></u></p>
 <p data-pid="qcsL0L7W">别假定没有回馈和负面的回馈是一回事。如果你需要回馈，但是却没有，就问吧！</p>

 <p data-pid="mVjXJaWJ">附：英文原文</p>
 <h1>INFP Personal Growth</h1>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p data-pid="muYdVzZU">What does Success mean to an INFP?</p>
 <p data-pid="CLxwnDh5">INFPs are creative, sensitive souls who take their lives very seriously. They seek harmony and authenticity in their relationships with others. They value creativity, spirituality, and honoring the individual self above all else. They are very tuned into inequity and unfairness against people, and get great satisfaction from conquering such injustices. An INFP is a perfectionist who will rarely allow themselves to feel successful, although they will be keenly aware of failures. INFPs also get satisfaction from being in touch with their creativity. For the INFP, personal success depends upon the condition of their closest relationships, the development of their creative abilities, and the continual support of humanity by serving people in need, fighting against injustice, or in some other way working to make the world a better place to be.</p>
 <p data-pid="CuOqpsnr">Allowing Your INFP Strengths to Flourish</p>
 <p data-pid="ztqJ7Jie">As an INFP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see your place in the world, and how you can better use your talents to achieve your dreams.</p>
 <p data-pid="I0HZ0VZk">Nearly all INFPs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should embrace and nourish these strengths:</p>
 <p data-pid="hOwLmnPN">Highly creative, artistic and spiritual, they can produce wonderful works of art, music and literature. INFPs are natural artists. They will find great satisfaction if they encourage and develop their artistic abilities. That doesn't mean that an INFP has to be a famous writer or painter in order to be content. Simply the act of "creating" will be a fulfilling source of renewal and refreshment to the INFP. An INFP should allow himself or herself some artistic outlet, because it will add enrichment and positive energy to their life.</p>
 <p data-pid="kX00HBll">They're more spiritually aware than most people, and are more in touch with their soul than others. Most INFPs have strong Faith. Those that don't may feel as if they're missing something important. An INFP should nourish their faith.</p>
 <p data-pid="oNqghHV0">INFPs are very aware of social injustice, and empathize with the underdog. Their empathy for the underdog and hyper-awareness of social injustice makes them extremely compassionate and nurturing towards disadvantaged members of our society. INFPs will feel most useful and fulfilled when they are fighting to help people who have been misfortunate in our society. They may be teachers, ministers, writers, counsellors or psychologists, but they will most likely all spend extra time trying to help people with special problems. An INFP can find a tremendous amount of satisfaction by enacting some kind of social change that will help the underdog.</p>
 <p data-pid="IFRo9UBe">They're usually good listeners who genuinely want to hear about someone's problems, and genuinely want to help them. This makes them outstanding counsellors, and good friends. An INFP may find great satisfaction from volunteering as a counselor.</p>
 <p data-pid="LZyJwvwE">They accept and value people as individuals, and are strongly egalitarian. They believe that an individual has the right to be themself, without having their attitudes and perspectives brought under scrutiny. Accordingly, they have a great deal of tolerance and acceptance dealing with people who might encounter negative judgment from society in general. They can see something positive in everyone. They believe in individuals. If they give themselves the opportunity, an INFP can become a much-needed source of self-esteem and confidence for people who cannot find it on their own. In this way, they can nurture a "sick soul" back to health.</p>
 <p data-pid="65mIhT5p">Usually deep and intelligent, they're able to grasp difficult concepts with relative ease. They usually do quite well academically, and will find that educating their minds nourishes their need to think deeply.</p>
 <p data-pid="Ccfb_e6f">INFPs who have developed their Extraverted iNtuition to the extent that they can perceive the world about them objectively and quickly will find that they enjoy these special gifts:</p>
 <p data-pid="rMh93Lf5">They will have a great deal of insight into people's characters. They will quickly and thoroughly understand where a person is coming from by assessing their motives and feelings. These well-developed INFP individuals make outstanding psychologists (such as Isabel Briggs Myers herself) and counselors. They might also be great fiction writers, because they're able to develop very complex, real characters.</p>
 <p data-pid="jkK6Zt-0">They will quickly understand different situations, and quickly grasp new concepts. They will find that they're able to do anything that they put their mind to, although they may not find it personally satisfying. Things may seem to come easily to these INFPs. Although they're able to conquer many different kinds of tasks and situations, these INFPs will be happiest doing something that seems truly important to them. Although they may find that they can achieve the "mainstream" type of success with relative ease, they are not likely to find happiness along that path, unless they are living their lives with authenticity and depth.</p>
 <p data-pid="M7CXheex">The INFP who augments their strong, internal value system (Introverted Feeling) with a well-developed intuitive way of perceiving the world (Extraverted iNtuition) can be a powerful force for social change. Their intense values and strong empathy for the underprivileged, combined with a reliable and deeply insightful understanding of the world that we live in, creates an individual with the power to make a difference (such as Mother Teresa - an INFP).</p>
 <br>
 <p data-pid="6wWhLpRH">Potential Problem Areas</p>
 <p data-pid="BhAuFlln">With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be no "good". Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.</p>
 <p data-pid="Uri-rRP2">INFPs are rare, intelligent, creative beings with many special gifts. I would like for the INFP to keep in mind some of the many positive things associated with being an INFP as they read some of this more negative material. Also remember that the weaknesses associated with being an INFP are natural to your type. Although it may be depressing to read about your type's weaknesses, please remember that we offer this information to enact positive change. We want people to grow into their own potential, and to live happy and successful lives.</p>
 <p data-pid="0rkixajh">Most of the weaker characteristics that are found in INFPs are due to their dominant Feeling function overshadowing the rest of their personality. When the dominant function of Introverted Feeling overshadows everything else, the INFP can't use Extraverted iNtuition to take in information in a truly objective fashion. In such cases, an INFP may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degrees:</p>
 <p data-pid="Pz-S_BDx">May be extremely sensitive to any kind of criticism</p>
 <p data-pid="2yxFTV_E">May perceive criticism where none was intended</p>
 <p data-pid="oJ1gxeuw">May have skewed or unrealistic ideas about reality</p>
 <p data-pid="KXDhWMc3">May be unable to acknowledge or hear anything that goes against their personal ideas and opinions</p>
 <p data-pid="qD0DPvCi">May blame their problems on other people, seeing themselves as victims who are treated unfairly</p>
 <p data-pid="W6kD6DdQ">May have great anger, and show this anger with rash outpourings of bad temper</p>
 <p data-pid="Jc09b84s">May be unaware of appropriate social behavior</p>
 <p data-pid="msAB1NAd">May be oblivious to their personal appearance, or to appropriate dress</p>
 <p data-pid="c4QIui1d">May come across as eccentric, or perhaps even generally strange to others, without being aware of it</p>
 <p data-pid="pf9rleuo">May be unable to see or understand anyone else's point of view</p>
 <p data-pid="IcNHF3O-">May value their own opinions and feelings far above others</p>
 <p data-pid="Yk4PJ4e6">May be unaware of how their behavior affects others</p>
 <p data-pid="18Ef0L_e">May be oblivious to other people's need</p>
 <p data-pid="_6oxRnJl">May feel overwhelmed with tension and stress when someone expresses disagreement with the INFP, or disapproval of the INFP</p>
 <p data-pid="wIFbc5iV">May develop strong judgments that are difficult to unseed against people who they perceive have been oppressive or suppressive to them</p>
 <p data-pid="zhaKVlAP">Under great stress, may obsess about details that are unimportant to the big picture of things</p>

 <p data-pid="HJvI9_yL">Explanation of Problems</p>
 <p data-pid="flHxaR58">Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common INFP problem of only taking in data that justifies their personal opinions. INFPs are usually very intense and sensitive people, and feel seriously threatened by criticism. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their own as criticism of their own perspective. If the INFP does not learn how to deal with this perceived criticism, the INFP will begin to shut out the incoming information that causes them pain. This is a natural survivalistic technique for the INFP personality. The main driver to the INFP personality is Introverted Feeling, whose purpose is to maintain and honor an intensely personal system of values and morals. If an INFP's personal value system is threatened by external influences, the INFP shuts out the threatening data in order to preserve and honor their value system. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the INFP who exercises this type of self-protection regularly will become more and more unaware of other people's perspectives, and thus more and more isolated from a real understanding of the world that they live in. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will always find fault with the external world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have unreasonable expectations, and will be unable to accept blame.</p>
 <p data-pid="uOenctr-">Its not an uncommon tendency for the INFP to look to the external world primarily for information that will support their ideas and values. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting INFP personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful. Since the INFP's dominant function to their personality is Introverted Feeling, they must balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted iNtuitive function. The INFP takes in information via Extraverted iNtuition. This is also the INFP's primary way of dealing with the external world. If the INFP uses Extraverted iNtuition only to serve the purposes of Introverted Feeling, then the INFP is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result, the INFP does not take in enough information about the external world to have a good sense of what's going on. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as selfish and unrealistic. Depending on how serious the problem is, they may appear to be anything from "a bit eccentric" to "way out there". Many times other people are unable to understand or relate to these people.</p>

 <p data-pid="2y83iJ1B">Solutions</p>
 <p data-pid="Jt2vrjgq">To grow as an individual, the INFP needs to focus on opening their perspective to include a more accurate picture of what is really going on in the world. In order to be in a position in which the INFP is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their internal value system, the INFP needs to know that its value system is not threatened by the new information. The INFP must consciously tell himself/herself that an opinion that does not concede with their own is not an indictment of their entire character.</p>
 <p data-pid="_RqSZ9hH">The INFP who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for taking in information. Do they take in information to better understand a situation or concept? Or, do they take in information to support a personal idea or cause? At the moment when something is perceived, is the INFP concerned with twisting that perception to fit in with their personal values? Or is she/he concerned with absorbing the information objectively? To achieve a better understanding of the external world, the INFP should try to perceive information objectively, before fitting it into their value system. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with their values, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should try to see situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal judgments about the situations or the other people's perspectives. In general, they should work on exercising their iNtuition in a truly Extraverted sense. In other words, they should use iNtuition to take in information about the world around them for the sake of understanding the world, rather than take in information to support their own conclusions. The INFP who successfully perceives things objectively may be quite a powerful force for positive change.</p>

 <p data-pid="07XhQ2rw">Living Happily in our World as an INFP</p>
 <p data-pid="aYcnaZ3P">Some INFPs have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an unawareness of appropriate social behavior, an unawareness of how they come across to others, or unrealistic expectations of others. Any one of these three issues stem from using Extraverted iNtuition in a diminished manner. An INFP who takes in information for the sake of understanding the world around them, rather than one who takes in information only to support their own ideas, will have a clearer, more objective understanding of how society values social behaviors and attitudes. He or she will also be more aware of how they are perceived by others, and will have more realistic expectations for others' behavior within a relationship. Such well-adjusted INFPs will fit happily into our society.</p>
 <p data-pid="WJL3A5ZW">Unless you really understand Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a difficult task to suddenly start to use iNtuition in an Extraverted direction. It's difficult to even understand what that means, much less to incorporate that directive into your life. With that in mind, I am providing some specific suggestions that may help you to begin exercising your Extraverted iNtuition more fully:</p>
 <p data-pid="rEOYXJkc">Take care to notice what people look like in different social situations. Look at their hair, their skin, their makeup (or lack thereof), their clothes, the condition of their clothes, their shoes, their facial expressions. Don't compare others to your own appearance, or pass judgment on their appearance, simply take in the information.</p>
 <p data-pid="7RXzJkWs">Think of a situation in your life in which you weren't sure how to behave. Now try to understand how one or two other people would see the situation. Don't compare their behavior to your own, i.e. "she would know better than me what to do", or "why is it so easy for her, but so hard for me". Rather, try to understand how they would see the situation. Would it be seen as a problem, or as an opportunity? Would it be taken seriously or lightly? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or comparing it to your own.</p>
 <p data-pid="oSPQkzID">When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time to talking about the other person. Concentrate on really understanding where that person is coming from with their concerns. Ask questions.</p>
 <p data-pid="agu99ZEv">Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself "this person has their own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life than they are with mine." Remember that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you. It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what that person is doing right now. What things are they encountering, what thoughts are they having? Don't pass judgment, or compare their situation to your own.</p>
 <p data-pid="cV-2Mvam">Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any length of time.</p>
 <p data-pid="6Ki-8oNU">Ten Rules to Live By to Achieve INFP Success</p>
 <p data-pid="oIFQQQcL">Feed Your Strengths! Encourage your natural artistic abilities and creativity. Nourish your spirituality. Give yourself opportunities to help the needy or underprivileged.</p>
 <p data-pid="NnLIdwAb">Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some traits are strengths and some are weaknesses. Facing and dealing with your weaknesses doesn't mean that you have to change who you are, it means that you want to be the best You possible. By facing your weaknesses, you are honoring your true self, rather than attacking yourself.</p>
 <p data-pid="A00RJgJn">Express Your Feelings. Don't let unexpressed emotions build up inside of you. If you have strong feelings, sort them out and express them, Don't let them build up inside you to the point where they become unmanageable!</p>
 <p data-pid="njgUhise">Listen to Everything. Try not to dismiss anything immediately. Let everything soak in for awhile, then apply judgment.</p>
 <p data-pid="k5G-ua8W">Smile at Criticism. Remember that people will not always agree with you or understand you, even if they value you greatly. Try to see disagreement and criticism as an opportunity for growth. In fact, that is exactly what it is.</p>
 <p data-pid="BTxGV5vu">Be Aware of Others. Remember that there are 15 other personality types out there who see things differently than you see them. Try to identify other people's types. Try to understand their perspectives.</p>
 <p data-pid="V7LJDK8e">Be Accountable for Yourself. Remember that YOU have more control over your life than any other person has.</p>
 <p data-pid="86FBuBQD">Be Gentle in Your Expectations. You will always be disappointed with others if you expect too much of them. Being disappointed with another person is the best way to drive them away. Treat others with the same gentleness that you would like to be treated with.</p>
 <p data-pid="7YRXujTi">Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself by assuming the worst. Remember that a positive attitude often creates positive situations.</p>
 <p data-pid="6V4vLdiT">When in Doubt, Ask Questions! Don't assume that the lack of feedback is the same thing as negative feedback. If you need feedback and don't have any, ask for it.</p>
