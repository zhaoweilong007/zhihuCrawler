 <p data-pid="qj9dk8iC">Although there are some limits for college students to read in libraries every day, according to my college memory, reading is still very valuable to some degree.</p>
 <p data-pid="v9pPa7sG">At the end of 1199 AD, Lu You wrote in his poem, "Eventually we feel what got from paper is shallow, we must esteem practice if we want to know thoroughly." Indeed, reading should be combined with thinking and practicing systematically. Idealistic and monotonous reading is prone to make us lose interest, so we should master materialist outlooks and that methodologies, learn correct methods of reading and arrange our time of reading, sports and entertainment reasonably.</p>
 <p data-pid="fq7Fiusx">Since you initially enter the university that admitted you, you'd better make proper use of its libraries. After you graduated from ivory tower and started your work, it will be difficult for you to have the opportunities of entering libraries as often as you can do in university. Even if it's difficult for you to profoundly understand the contents of these books or these books can't guarantee monetary profit, browsing more books as an interest will also broaden your horizon and adjust your personality.</p>
 <p data-pid="XxzVtlYZ">Even though you don't like reading the books of university libraries, your university libraries can usually provide you with better reading environments than your dormitory (especially, in libraries the illuminations are brighter, the environments quieter and less smelly).</p>
