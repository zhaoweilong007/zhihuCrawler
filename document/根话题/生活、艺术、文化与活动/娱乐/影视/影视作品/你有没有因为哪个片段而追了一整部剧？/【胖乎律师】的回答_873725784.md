 <p data-pid="XtSj8hFB">Trask: Are you finished, Mr. Slade?</p>
 <p data-pid="NpAJf-Kx">你讲完了没有斯莱德中校。</p>
 <p data-pid="ENs9tcT6">Frank: No, I'm just getting warmed up! I don't know who went to this place, William Howard Taft, William Jennings Bryant, William Tell, whoever, their spirit is dead, if they ever had one. It's gone. You're building a rat ship here, a vessel for seagoing snitches. And if you think you're preparing these minnows for manhood, you better think again, because I say you're killing the very spirit this institution proclaims it instills. What a sham! What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today? I mean, the only class in this act is sitting next to me, I'm here to tell you this boy's soul is intact, it's non-negotiable, you know how I know, someone here, and I'm not gonna say who, offered to buy it, only Charlie here wasn't selling.</p>
 <p data-pid="9OFsEWMy">不~~~我才刚刚开了个头，我不知道那些有名的校友是谁—威廉?霍华德塔夫、威廉?詹尼斯?布莱克、威廉?蒂尔，管他呢；他们的精神已经死了，就算有也不在了。你眼下正在打造用来运送告密者的远洋轮，要是你以为正在把他们培养成男子汉，那么你想错了，因为你杀死了恰恰是这种精神，也就这学校所声称的立校精神~多么可耻，你们今天上演的到底是一出什么样的闹剧，在这件事情当中唯一值得夸奖的人就坐在我身边，让我告诉你们这个孩子的品行无可挑剔，这是毋庸置疑，以为我不知道，这里有人~我不说是谁，想收买他。查理不会出卖自己的灵魂</p>
 <p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p>
 <p data-pid="RBTLcBG_">Trask: Sir, you're out of order.</p>
 <p data-pid="UxchC9Ud">不要破坏规矩</p>
 <p data-pid="Fdll3EaQ">Frank: I'll show you out of order. You don't know what out of order is, Mr. Trask, I'd show you, but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too fucking blind, if I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a flame thrower to this place! Out of order? Who the hell do you think you're talking to? I've been around, you know? There was a time I could see, and I have seen, boys like these, younger than these, their arms torn out, their legs ripped off, but there is nothing like the sight of an amputated spirit. There is no prosthetic for that, you think you're merely sending this splendid foot solider back home to Oregen with his tail between his legs, but I say you're executing his soul! And why? Because he is not a Baird man. Baird men, you hurt this boy, you're gonna be Baird bums, the lot of you. And Harry, Jimmy, and Trent, wherever you are out there, fuck you too!</p>
 <p data-pid="cohnlVZ0">让你见识见识什么是破坏规矩，你不知道什么叫破坏规矩克拉斯先生，真该让你见识，可我太老了！我太累了！该死的我还是个瞎子.要是五年前，我会拿火焰喷射剂把这给烧了，破坏规矩，你以为在跟谁说话，我可是久经杀场，那时候我还能看德见，我看见的是象他们这么大孩子们胳膊被炸段了，双腿被截段了，可我从来没见过孩子们的精神有过任何程度的缺损，他们从不缺少这种精神。你以为你只是把这个优秀的“战士”潜送回家？让他回到俄勒冈，从此你们就万事大吉了吗？可我要说你们正在谋杀这个孩子的精神，为什么！就因为他不是一个拜尔德人，拜尔德人？你们伤害了这个孩子，你们就是拜尔德的混蛋，你们全是。哈瑞、吉米、享特，不管你们坐在哪，见你们的鬼。</p>
 <p data-pid="cvTSoXbi">Trask: Stand down, Mr. Slade!</p>
 <p data-pid="SEuzoCvV">请你肃静,斯莱德中校</p>
 <p data-pid="kKCoCPXe">Frank: I'm not finished. As I came in here, I heard those words: cradle of leadership. Well, when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall, and it has fallen here, it has fallen. Makers of men, creators of leaders, be careful what kind of leaders you're producin' here. I don't know if Charlie's silence here today is right or wrong, I'm not a judge or jury, but I can tell you this: he won't sell anybody out to buy his future! And that my friends is called integrity, that's called courage. Now, that's the stuff leaders should be made of. Now I have come to crossroads in my life, I always knew what the right path was. Without exception, I knew, but I never took it, you know why, it was too * hard. Now here's Charlie, he's come to the crossroads, he has chosen a path. It's the right path, it's a path made of principle that leads to character. Let him continue on his journey. You hold this boy's future in your hands, committee, it's a valuable future, believe me. Don't destroy it, protect it. Embrace it. It's gonna make you proud one day, I promise you. How's that for cornball?</p>
 <p data-pid="89akufxV">我还说完呢~我刚一进到这里，就听到那些话：“未来领袖的摇篮”如果架子断了，摇篮也就掉了，它已经掉了，它随落了，造就青年，培养未来的领袖，看吧！要小心了，你们在培养什么样的领袖，我不知道！今天查理保持沉默是对还是错，我虽然不是法官但我可以告诉你，他不会为了自己的前途而出卖任何人。朋友们！这就是人们常说的正直，这就是勇气，这才是未来领袖所具有的品质。现在我到了一个人生的十字路口，我一向知道哪条路是正确的，这毋庸置疑~我知道，可我没走，为什么？因为作到这一点他太坚难了。轮到查理了，他也在一个人生的十字路口，他必须选择一条路，一条正确的路，一条有原则的路，一条成全他人格的路，让他沿着这条是继续前行，这孩子的前途掌握在你们的手里委员们，他会前途无量的，相信我，别毁了他！保护他！支持他！我保证会有一天你们会为此而感到骄傲。</p>

 <p data-pid="rZA5sM5b">Will：it's not the greatest country in the world.professor.that's my ansewr！</p>
 <p data-pid="94Qs90Ll">美国不是世界上最伟大的国家,教授，这就是我的答案</p>
 <p data-pid="K5wQw1e_">P：you‘re saying......</p>
 <p data-pid="3-n4wkXe">你是说......</p>
 <p data-pid="2vRWaDIy">Will：yes</p>
 <p data-pid="Nf3FCt7I">是的）</p>
 <p data-pid="4Qv6YG8z">P：let's talk about......</p>
 <p data-pid="b1zFjpeG">我们来谈......</p>
 <p data-pid="eunSr8CY">W: fine, sharon, the NEA is a loser. yeah, it accounts for a penny out of our paycheck, but he gets to hit you with it any time he wants. it doesn't cost money, it costs votes. it costs airtime and column inches. You know why people don't like liberals？Because they lose. If liberals are so fuckin' smart，how come they lose so goddamn always？</p>
 <p data-pid="5uwjCLG_">莎伦，报业协会是窝囊废，没错，它花的都是纳税人的钱，却反过来攻击你，这不花钱，花的是票数，就花点广播时间和专栏长度。你知道为什么人们不喜欢自由主义者吗？因为他们是窝囊废。如果他们有那么聪明，又怎么会他妈一次没赢过？</p>
 <p data-pid="-Hb9Q6Q_">S：hey......</p>
 <p data-pid="CvGVeq4H">你....</p>
 <p data-pid="0avPfGZk">Will：And with a straight face you're gonna tell students that america is so star-spangled awesome that we’re the only ones in the world who have freedom？Canada has freedom, Japan has freedom, the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Australia, Belgium has freedom. [laughs] So 207 sovereign states in the world, like a hundred and eighty of them have freedom.</p>
 <p data-pid="gqINM8Z6">你还能面不改色的跟学生说美国是如此了不起，如此的星光璀璨，美国是世界上唯一一个有自由的国家吗？加拿大有自由，日本有自由，英国。法国、意大利、德国、西班牙、澳大利亚、比利时都是自由的国家。全球207个主权国家中，大概有180个都有自由。</p>
 <p data-pid="GS4d2JI7">M: Alright–</p>
 <p data-pid="OPgQJ3eg">好的~</p>
 <p data-pid="GbQwChOM">Will: And yeah, you, sorority girl. Just in case you accidentally wander into a voting booth one day, there's some things you should know, and one of them is, there's absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, 3rd in median household income, number 4 in labor force, and number 4 in exports. We lead the world in only 3 categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next 26 countries combined. 25 of whom are allies. Now,none of this is the fault of a 20 year old college student. But you, nonetheless, are without a doubt a member of the worst period generation period ever period. so when you ask what makes us the greatest country in the world, I don't know what the fuck you are talking about.，Yosemite？</p>
 <p data-pid="4Pgl7qJQ">还有你，联谊会女生。以免你以后不小心乱入了投票站，有些事你是要知道的。 比如你的问题毫无根据，美国是世界上最伟大的国家吗？我们识字率排第7，数学第27.科学第22，预期寿命第49，婴儿死亡率排178名，中等家庭收入排名第3，劳动力排第4，出口额排第4。只有三项我们排榜首，监禁人员所占总人数比重，相信天使的成年人数量以及国防开支。这项支出比后面26个国家总和还多，其中25个还是盟国。当年，这都不是你这个20岁大学生的错，但你却毋庸置疑的生活在这个史上最糟糕最悲剧的年代，所以你问我是什么造就了这个最伟大的国度，我真不懂你他妈在放什么狗屁。国家公园吗？</p>
 <p data-pid="9_BhQc14">Will：We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right. we fought for the moral reasons. We passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons.we waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed. we cared about our neighbours. we put our money where our mouths were and we never beat our chest. 　We built great big things, made ungodly technological advences, explored the universe, cured diseases, and we cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars,acted like men.We aspired to intelligence.We didn't belittle it.It didn't make us feel inferior. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election.And we didn't…we didn't scare so easy.Ahem，we are able to be all these things and do all these things because we are informed. By greatmen, men who were revered.　The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is a problem.America is not the greatest country in the world anymore.</p>
 <p data-pid="wwgGJqra">我们过去的确辉煌过，我们会为正义而拼，为道德而战，因合乎道德而立良法，因违背道德而废恶法，我们为穷人而战而并非讨伐穷人，甘愿牺牲，关心邻里，勤劳踏实，而不是空口说大话，我们有过伟大的发明，有过逆天的科学创造，探索太空，治愈疾病，还出过世界上最出色的艺术家，有过世界上最棒的经济体制，可上九天揽月，虽是一介凡人。追求知识，不轻视，知识不会让我们觉得低人一等，不会以上届选举的投票选择来给自己定性左右派，我们也……我们也不会轻易畏惧。以前之所以能做到这些，是因为我们遥遥领先，因受人尊敬的伟大人物，解决问题的第一步是要认清症结所在美国再也不是世界上最伟大的国家了。</p>
 <p data-pid="Be-okfc1">Will: Enough？</p>
