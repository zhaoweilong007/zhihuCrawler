 <p data-pid="R4CgB_08">说实话，如果按照p社游戏视角，我会觉得中国是个非常讨厌的国家。</p>
 <p data-pid="43KrynuL">本来这就是个严重一些的流感，后果也就是减1人口。糊弄一下说这是个悲剧但是我们无法避免就行了。</p>
 <p data-pid="PoAGpYRV">结果中国尼玛死脑筋，非要封城停工。他这样是救了那1人口，但是这可对经济是毁灭性的打击啊。钱和1人口，哪个重要?</p>
 <p data-pid="A9-Tzpd_">他这么干让我的民众看到了以后，我今后还怎么糊弄我的民众说我没有办法？现在我不采取中国自断经济的做法，就得稳定度—50%。</p>
 <p data-pid="Ia9LGXZt">本来之前像这样的大流行病只用人口-1，现在不仅人口-1还要稳定度-50%。全tm赖中国，破坏游戏规则。</p>
 <p data-pid="NY7oz3uP">我肯定是不能封城停工的，毕竟作为资本家 赚钱就是我存活在这个世界上唯一的理由。不让我赚钱比杀了我还难受。</p>
 <p data-pid="E3rdarXa">那我只有抹黑中国，诱导我的民众不相信中国的成果，告诉他们中国都是骗人的。这样至少稳定度不会减少太多。</p>
 <p data-pid="AlCwgCVU">要我说中国也是蠢，我虽然整天嘴上挂着人权第一，你个憨憨还真就信了？p民的生命有什么好救的，最重要的是经济啊！人权只不过是让p民安心给我创造经济价值的口号。你为了p民放弃经济 不是本末倒置了吗？到底会不会玩？</p>

 <p data-pid="PMUWPM-b">if looking at this coronavirus like we are playing paradox games. China is indeed an annoying country.</p>
 <p data-pid="lUKA0Vhf">This is just a flu but more deadly,the worst thing could happen is population-1. all I have to do is to tell my people that this is a tragedy and there was nothing we could do.</p>
 <p data-pid="3w5VlVUt">But now China is acting like a dumb ass.shutting down the city and factories to save that 1 point of population. well china did save them,but at the price of heavy economy loss. don't u see which is more important? it's just few millions of people's lives,it's not worth it.</p>
 <p data-pid="nLHY8OU_">and now my people are witnessing China saving lives at all cost. How the hell am I supposed to fool my people in future after they saw what China had done what I called impossible? Now if I don't act like China , I'm gonna lose 1 point of population and 50% of social stability.</p>
 <p data-pid="D-6nQOTq">it's all because of China disobeying the rules of this game. now we all have to pay more to get through this virus.</p>
 <p data-pid="5znjTgX2">I don't wanna shut down the city. I'm a capitalist after all. money is the one true god I serve. there's no difference in killing me and keeping me from making money.</p>
 <p data-pid="beU_yJtb">all I can do is to lie to my people about China's success against the virus.make them hate China so they won't believe in anything China says or does. this won't solve the problem,but at least it reduce less social stability.</p>
 <p data-pid="-BVwcQYn">though I'm always talking about human rights, I didn't mean it. it's just a slogan to trick my people,to make them believe that my choice is the only right choice. but China is like a noob player,taking this slogan seriously.</p>
 <p data-pid="_2OpF4iI">come on,man.it's all poor and old people who can't pay for the medical attention. why are u trying to save these useless population who won't be able to create economy value anymore?</p>
 <p data-pid="eNg5f7WQ">economy is all that matters.we have to save our economy by all means.</p>
