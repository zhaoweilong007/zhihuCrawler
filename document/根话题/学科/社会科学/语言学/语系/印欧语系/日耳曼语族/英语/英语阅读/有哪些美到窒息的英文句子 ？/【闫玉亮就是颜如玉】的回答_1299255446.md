 <p data-pid="9rwgmcAp">英文名著里，美丽的句子、段落非常多。摘抄一些个人印象深刻的：</p>
 <p data-pid="51wG_Bhc">1、《呼啸山庄》的结尾：</p>
 <p data-pid="vejG5LGh">My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk. When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and slates jutted off here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.</p>
 <p data-pid="wOgzT-25">I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the moor: on middle one grey, and half buried in the heath; Edgar Linton’s only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff’s still bare.</p>
 <p data-pid="94Nmtj69">I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.</p>

 <p data-pid="aYrxFvxL">2、《双城记》开篇：</p>
 <p data-pid="ZEFz1pAI">It was the best of times,<br>
  it was the worst of times,<br>
  it was the age of wisdom,<br>
  it was the age of foolishness,<br>
  it was the epoch of belief,<br>
  it was the epoch of incredulity,<br>
  it was the season of Light,<br>
  it was the season of Darkness,<br>
  it was the spring of hope,<br>
  it was the winter of despair, <br>
  We had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way— in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>

 <p data-pid="7kly_BRo">3、《丧钟为谁而鸣》by John Donne</p>
 <p data-pid="EaraZ_LB">//准确说，这首诗不叫这个名字。当然，作者也不是海明威。</p>
 <p data-pid="r7AqRIVV">No man is an island,<br>
  Entire of itself.<br>
  Each is a piece of the continent,<br>
  A part of the main.<br>
  If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
  Europe is the less.<br>
  As well as if a promontory were.<br>
  As well as if a manor of thine own<br>
  Or of thine friend's were.<br>
  Each man's death diminishes me,<br>
  For I am involved in mankind.<br>
  Therefore, send not to know<br>
  For whom the bell tolls,<br>
  It tolls for thee.</p>
 <p data-pid="94uqoOtD">4、《铁蹄》开篇</p>
 <p data-pid="4KQ2DkY9">The soft summer wind stirs the redwoods, and Wild-Water ripples sweet cadences over its mossy stones. There are butterflies in the sunshine, and from everywhere arises the drowsy hum of bees. It is so quiet and peaceful, and I sit here, and ponder, and am restless. It is the quiet that makes me restless. It seems unreal. All the world is quiet, but it is the quiet before the storm. I strain my ears, and all my senses, for some betrayal of that impending storm. Oh, that it may not be premature! That it may not be premature!</p>

 <p data-pid="4Jq5pSRx">5、《消失的地平线》</p>
 <p data-pid="Ueryjegu">里面有很多超美的景物描写，仅摘抄一段。</p>
 <p data-pid="lhAykcLk">The night dragged on, as if each minute were something heavy and tangible that had to be pushed to make way for the next. Moonlight faded after a time, and with it that distant specter of the mountain; then the triple mischiefs of darkness, cold, and wind increased until dawn. As though at its signal, the wind dropped, leaving the world in compassionate quietude. Framed in the pale triangle ahead, the mountain showed again, gray at first, then silver, then pink as the earliest sun rays caught the summit. In the lessening gloom the valley itself took shape, revealing a floor of rock and shingle sloping upwards. It was not a friendly picture, but to Conway, as he surveyed, there came a queer perception of fineness in it, of something that had no romantic appeal at all, but a steely, almost an intellectual quality. The white pyramid in the distance compelled the mind's assent as passionlessly as a Euclidean theorem, and when at last the sun rose into a sky of deep delphinium blue, he felt only a little less than comfortable again.</p>

 <p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p>
 <p data-pid="F2rNCKAV">Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
  And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;<br>
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
  And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br>
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
  By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br>
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
  Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
  When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>

 <p data-pid="yWNRVyjr">最后，贴一篇王佐良翻译的Samuel Ullman的《青春》，中英文俱佳，值得诵读。</p>
 <p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p>
 <p data-pid="dNLq8MFU">Youth《青春》（王佐良译文）</p>
 <p data-pid="Hu82pZKx">Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.</p>
 <p data-pid="FFXEn7Ba">青春不是年华，而是心境；青春不是桃面、丹唇、柔膝，而是深沉的意志，恢宏的想象，炙热的感情；青春是生命的深泉在涌流。</p>
 <p data-pid="DUrfRyE3">Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.</p>
 <p data-pid="0L0UaWz0">青春气贯长虹，勇锐盖过怯弱，进取压倒苟安。如此锐气，二十后生而有之，六旬男子则更多见。年岁有加，并非垂老，理想丢弃，方堕暮年。</p>
 <p data-pid="5MBloCZ_">Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.</p>
 <p data-pid="WbgMakr1">岁月悠悠，衰微只及肌肤；热忱抛却，颓废必致灵魂。忧烦，惶恐，丧失自信，定使心灵扭曲，意气如灰。</p>
 <p data-pid="kqBO08XJ">Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing childlike appetite of what's next and the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station: so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the Infinite, so long are you young.</p>
 <p data-pid="gS5yewnR">无论年届花甲，抑或二八芳龄，心中皆有生命之欢乐，奇迹之诱惑，孩童般天真久盛不衰。人人心中皆有一台天线，只要你从天上人间接受美好、希望、欢乐、勇气和力量的信号，你就青春永驻，风华常存。</p>
 <p data-pid="DOtm3kfc">When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at 20, but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at 80.</p>
 <p data-pid="-LzlY00l">一旦天线下降，锐气便被冰雪覆盖，玩世不恭、自暴自弃油然而生，即使年方二十，实已垂垂老矣；然则只要树起天线，捕捉乐观信号，你就有望在八十高龄告别尘寰时仍觉年轻。</p>
