 <p data-pid="zPcbAKRy">对斯洛伐克人来说，任何与中国有关的事情都是低价的。例如衣服。如果这些衣服是斯洛伐克制造的，那就很贵了。但如果它们是中国制造的，那么你可以在斯洛伐克以非常便宜的价格买到它们。它们很便宜，但质量也很差。所以现在人们认为中国制造的东西很便宜，质量也不好。</p>
 <p data-pid="3bAZVQP0">最近我和我父亲通电话，我告诉他我在阳台上。他告诉我，我不应该呆在那里，回去，因为阳台可能会掉下来。我父亲真的很爱中国和中国人民，但即使是像他这样的人也对中国有这些成见。这是因为这些陈规定型观念在人们心中根深蒂固，所以很难摆脱它们。</p>
 <p data-pid="i3reR39Q">在我来到中国之后，我还惊讶地看到购物中心的许多商店提供相当昂贵的服装。质量也很好。中国大城市的建筑也令人印象深刻。中国人也非常关心他们城市的环境。城市里到处都是鲜花和美丽的公园。斯洛伐克人对此一无所知。他们只是认为整个中国充满了污染，人们永远看不到蓝天，这里的每个人都在工厂里做着廉价劳动力。所以今后我会向每一个斯洛伐克人推荐去中国访问，让他们看到真相。</p>

 <p data-pid="cpqUSEpS">For Slovak people anything related to China is always cheep. For example clothing. If the clothes are made in Slovakia they are going to be expensive. But if they are made in China then you can buy them for very cheep in Slovakia. They are very cheap but also the quality is very bad. So now people consider anything made in China to be very cheap and have a bad quality. Recently I was talking with my father on the phone and I told him I'm on the balcony. He told me I shouldn't stay there and go back inside because the balcony may fall down. And my father really loves China and Chinese people but even person like him has these stereotypes about China. It's because these stereotypes are so strongly ingrained in the minds of people so it's very difficult to get rid of them.</p>
 <p data-pid="58D6_BxN">After I came to China I was also surprised to see many stores in shopping centers offering quite expensive clothing. The quality was also very good. Also the architecture in big cities in China is very impressive. Chinese people also take great care of environment in their cities. Cities are full of flowers and beautiful parks. Slovak people know nothing about this. They just think the entire China is full of pollution, people can never see the blue sky and everyone here is working as a cheap labor in a factory. So in the future I will recommend to every Slovak person to visit China so they can see the truth.</p>
