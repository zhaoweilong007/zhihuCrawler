 <p data-pid="weXDxRFU">When I was making <i>Dune</i>, the thing I needed to get right was the right incarnation for the sandworm. It was a very long process. We worked with several designers to explore its shape. We made hundreds of drawings trying to find very precise qualities for the sandworm. We had long discussions about what we were looking for. It was a process that took about a year. I'm very proud of how it looks. The idea was to make sure that the sandworm would be as realistic as possible, that it would be totally logical that such a beast would come from that kind of environment. Like Frank Herbert wrote in his book, it had to be inspired by nature. So when I was thinking about the special effects of <i>Dune</i>, I still wanted to approach it by embracing and respecting the laws of Nature.</p>
 <p data-pid="bXaWmRTE">当我在制作《沙丘》，我一定要做好的，就是有关沙虫的正确塑造。做沙虫花了很长的时间，我们同时和好几个设计师一起探索它的外形。我们画了数百张的设计稿，去研究沙虫的每一个精确细节。我们花了很长的时间去讨论我们想要寻找的是什么。这样的过程大概持续了一年，我很自豪它最终的效果。我们想让它看起来尽可能真实，让大家相信那样的环境会塑造出的怪物就是长这样的。就像弗兰克·赫伯特书里写的那样，它必须是受到自然的启发。当我在考虑《沙丘》的特效时，我依旧想拥抱和尊重自然法则。</p>
